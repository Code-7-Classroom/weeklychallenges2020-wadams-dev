/*
VERY EASY: Create two variables and assign a
number to each. Console log the difference between the numbers.
Example output: “The difference between 6 and 2 is 4”
*/


//Create two variables and assign a number to each
var firstNumber = 6;
var secondNumber = 2;

//calculate difference between two numbers
var difference = firstNumber - secondNumber;

//log the difference between the number
console.log('The difference between ' + firstNumber + ' and ' + secondNumber + ' is ' + difference + '.');
